# my-Read-App

###Project Overview
### React Developer Nanodegree Project
In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

This is a project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The starter code was taken from this repo: https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter
The starter code provides a static example of the CSS and HTML markup but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. Goal is to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.
